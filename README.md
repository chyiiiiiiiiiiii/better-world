## Concept and Inspiration
**Better World** originated from our awareness of escalating environmental issues and the crucial role of early education in fostering responsible environmental stewardship. We aspired to create a platform that educates and empowers children, making environmental conservation an engaging and enjoyable part of their learning experience.

## Game Design and Educational Strategy
The game is an interactive idle experience designed for children, using simple click-based interactions to make it accessible to a broad age range. It incorporates educational mini-games on recycling and energy conservation, employing intuitive gameplay and real-world technology integration to teach important environmental concepts. Key educational components include:

1. **Sorting and Catching Trash:** These mini-games teach waste segregation and recycling awareness through interactive gameplay.
2. **Scanning Trash and Appliances:** Utilizing camera and AI technology, these activities connect learning with real-world application, teaching children to identify recyclable materials and understand energy efficiency.

We've also integrated Google Wallet to transform the cards collected in the game into digital collectibles, adding a tangible value to the players' achievements. Moreover, the game's focus on featuring endangered animals as collectibles serves a dual purpose: it not only enhances the gaming experience but also raises awareness about wildlife conservation, aiming to foster a deeper connection between players and environmental protection efforts.

## Technical Development
We developed **Better World** using Flutter, emphasizing interactive and educational game elements with Canvas Widget and Lottie Animations. Gemini AI played a pivotal role in enhancing user interaction, linking in-game actions with real-world contexts.

## Multiple Platform Support
**Better World** can run on mobile, desktop, and web. We hope everybody can play on which platform they like. Also, shows how powerful Flutter is.

## Achievements and Impact
We are proud of creating an app that combines educational value with engaging gameplay, facilitating impactful learning about sustainability. Key achievements include:

- Integrating AI and camera technologies for an immersive learning experience.
- Designing a user-friendly and technologically advanced platform suitable for children.
- Observing children's enhanced understanding and appreciation of environmental conservation.

## Future Directions

- Collaborate with environmental organizations to introduce new mini-games.
- Broaden the environmental topics covered, ensuring a well-rounded educational experience.
